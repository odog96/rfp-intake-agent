# CLAUDE.md — RFP Intake Agent

## What this is
A deterministic LangGraph pipeline that reads clinical study RFP and protocol documents and
produces a provenance-backed variable set for the Delivery Strategy & Budgeting (DSB) team.

**Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` before writing code. It is the build contract, not background reading.**
`config/fields.yaml` is the single source of truth for what gets extracted.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **The LLM never decides control flow.** All graph edges are static Python or `Send`. No agent
   delegation, no tool-choosing agents, no LLM-routed conditional edges. If you find yourself
   writing "let the model decide which node runs next", stop — that is the bug we are rebuilding to fix.

2. **No value without evidence.** Every `FieldRecord` carries a verbatim `quote`, `doc_id`, and `page`.
   `quote` is validated as a substring of the source excerpt in code, after every extraction call.
   A record that fails validation is dropped and logged — never repaired by hand-waving.

3. **`not_found` ≠ `not_specified` ≠ `0`.** Keep the three terminal states distinct everywhere:
   schema, normalizer, report, and eval metrics.

4. **Never hardcode a field.** Fields come from `config/fields.yaml`. Prompts, schemas, validation,
   and report columns are all generated from the registry. If a change requires touching Python to
   add a variable, the design has drifted.

5. **Vendor SDKs live only in `llm/`.** The platform is Cloudera end to end: Cloudera AI Inference
   (CAII) is the inference layer for POC, demo and production; a LiteLLM proxy is used in local dev.
   Both are OpenAI-compatible, so the backend is a base URL in config. Do not introduce AWS Bedrock,
   Textract, or any other off-box managed service.

6. **The test suite runs offline.** `LLM_BACKEND=mock` by default in tests. Deterministic fixtures.
   No network in CI.

7. **Normalizers are pure functions with table-driven tests.** `graph/normalize` and `domain/units`
   contain zero LLM calls and zero I/O.

8. **Contradiction detection is code first.** Candidate detection is set logic over normalized values.
   The LLM only adjudicates a specific pair you already found. Never prompt "find contradictions".

9. **Nothing leaves the customer boundary.** All parsing is in-process (PyMuPDF/pdfplumber, Docling,
   local OCR). Any component that would transmit document content off-box sits behind
   `parser.allow_external`, off by default, and its use is recorded in the run's `audit.json`.

10. **The app never runs the graph.** The Cloudera AI Application triggers a CML Job and polls the run
    directory. One scheduled janitor job reaps stale runs — never one watcher per run.

## Scale reality check
6 concurrent users, 3–4 documents each. The CML Jobs API is the queue.
**Do not build a queue, a worker pool, a vector database, or Kubernetes manifests.**
If you think you need one, you have misread the requirements.

The throughput ceiling is our own CAII endpoint capacity, not a vendor rate limit — an over-eager
fan-out queues against ourselves and degrades latency for every other concurrent user.

## Commands
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt   # install dependencies
pip install -e .                  # install package in editable mode
pytest                            # offline test suite (mock LLM)
pytest -m integration             # requires live LLM endpoint
ruff check . && mypy .            # lint + types
python -m rfp_intake.job <run_id> # run pipeline for a single RFP package
python -m rfp_intake.eval         # golden-set scoring
```

## Running the pipeline
```bash
mkdir -p runs/<run_id>/inputs
cp <your-pdfs> runs/<run_id>/inputs/
python -m rfp_intake.job <run_id>
# Outputs: runs/<run_id>/status.json, runs/<run_id>/extraction.json
```

## Style
- Python 3.11+, `uv`, ruff, mypy strict on `domain/` and `graph/`.
- Pydantic v2 everywhere data crosses a boundary.
- Structured logging keyed by `run_id` / `task_id`. No print statements.
- Type-annotate every function. `Any` requires a comment justifying it.

## When you are unsure
Ask rather than assume, especially about clinical domain semantics. Wrong assumptions about
whether "40 sites" means per-country or total propagate silently into a budget. The domain
expert is Angus Gray (IQVIA DSB); route open questions to Oliver for him.
